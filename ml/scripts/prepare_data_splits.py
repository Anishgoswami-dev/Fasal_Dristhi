"""
FASAL DRISTHI — Reproducible Train/Validation Split Generator (Step 7)
Generates a stratified 80% train / 20% validation split strictly from:
  ml/datasets/plantvillage_isolated/train/

Guarantees:
1. Stratified 80/20 split preserving class distribution for all 38 classes.
2. Fixed random seed: 42 for 100% deterministic reproducibility.
3. Test partition (ml/datasets/plantvillage_isolated/test/) is kept completely untouched.
4. Zero overlap between train, validation, test, and heldout sets.
5. Saves clean manifest: ml/datasets/plantvillage_isolated/splits_manifest.json
